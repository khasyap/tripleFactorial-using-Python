# Triple Factorial using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

**Triple Factorial using Python** is a Python program that computes the **triple factorial** of a non-negative integer. The triple factorial is a mathematical function that generalizes the standard factorial by multiplying every third integer in descending order.

For a given integer `n`, the triple factorial (denoted `n!!!`) is defined as:
- `n!!! = n × (n−3) × (n−6) × ... × (until value ≤ 0)`

This project demonstrates how to implement mathematical algorithms in Python using loops and functions.

## 🧠 Problem Description

Given a number `n`, compute its triple factorial value using a custom Python function. This type of computation has applications in combinatorics and advanced math problems and also serves as a good exercise for learning recursive or iterative logic in programming.
